# viewer/common/view_model

Long-lived, DOM-free projection from a `TextModel` to renderable view lines.

## Pipeline and API

`ViewModel` owns the model, projected line collection, single cursor,
`ViewLayout`, decoration resolver, coordinate converter, and per-source hidden-area
sets. It is created once when a model attaches and updated in place.

```text
model line + grammar tokens + injected-text decorations
  -> ProjectedTextLine
  -> soft-wrap ModelLineProjection segments
  -> hidden-area filtering
  -> ViewLineData + model/view coordinate conversion
  -> viewport_data_from_view_model -> view_layout.ViewportData
```

- `ViewModelLinesFromProjectedModel` is always used. With wrapping disabled each
  line has a cheap identity projection; there is no separate
  `ViewModelLinesFromModelAsIs` implementation. Models above the tokenization
  safety thresholds remain on this projected collection and render default
  tokens; collection fallback belongs to the separate large-file plan.
- `CoordinatesConverter` is the closed concrete converter consumed by
  `ViewModel`, cursor closure construction, decorations, and browser input. Its
  current `Projected` arm retains `ViewModelLinesFromProjectedModel`; a future
  large-file as-is collection adds an identity arm without changing consumers.
- Injected text is projected before line breaking, so its width affects wrapping;
  source mappings, tokens, and decorations remain anchored to model offsets.
- Viewport construction uses one `get_view_lines_data` batch and a parallel
  needed mask. Each participating `Projected` model line constructs Monaco's
  five-callback injected-decoration context, computes absolute-view-line inline
  decorations, and performs one passive token-store read before examining the
  mask; therefore even an all-false mask reads once per projected model line.
  `Identity` retains Monaco's distinct early return and reads only when needed.
  The selected source-shaped decoration `Range` is adapted to the renderer's
  line-local offsets after `baseViewLineNumber` has been observed. No view read
  invokes the lexer.
- Configuration or injected-text/content flushes reproject affected state at the
  current whole-model granularity, invalidate decoration caches, and reproject the
  cursor from model coordinates. Incremental edit events are not part of the
  readonly contract.
- Cursor mutation has one source/reason-aware transition path. Model-side states
  validate through `TextModel`; view-side states clamp/normalize in this package
  and retain their authoritative projected position. Left/Right move by UTF-16
  scalar boundaries, Up/Down/Page move across wrapped view lines with visible-
  column residues, and Home/End choose the source model/view branch. Word/Line
  pointer continuation dispatches from the stored anchor kind. Source-shaped
  MoveTo and Line entries accept a required model position plus an optional
  already-known view position: absent converts model-to-view; supplied is kept
  only when its normalized view-to-model result matches the validated model
  position.
- `CursorMoveDirection` retains the source's full 15-member `Direction` enum;
  `SimpleMoveDirection` is its exact 11-member simple-move union, and
  `CursorMoveUnit` is the exact six-member `Unit` contract. Unscoped
  blank/wrapped-position and viewport directions, vertical model/folded units,
  and Left/Right HalfLine return without mutation at their explicit deferred
  branches.
- `CursorEventDispatcher` is the outgoing-only half of Monaco's
  `ViewModelEventDispatcher`: its heterogeneous queue carries cursor-state,
  ViewZones-changed, hidden-area-changed, and model-token facts. Cursor
  selection/version no-ops are filtered and queued cursor events can coalesce;
  the two payload-free change facts are always observable and merge only with
  their own kind, while model-token wrappers retain the identical source event,
  are never no-ops, and never merge. The dispatcher recursively drains
  reentrant outgoing facts and
  uses separate source-shaped listener-delivery state so a nested fire first
  finishes the remaining listeners for the current value. The nested value is
  then delivered before the initiating callback resumes. The root Viewer FIFO
  separately keeps public event pairs adjacent. It exposes
  `on_cursor_state_changed`, `on_view_zones_changed`,
  `on_hidden_areas_changed`, and `on_model_tokens_changed`;
  `ViewModel::dispose` disposes all emitters and clears pending outgoing facts
  and listener-
  delivery state. Generic browser View handlers, mixed view/outgoing
  collectors, and the editor-wide cross-event delivery queue remain outside
  this reduced common owner.
- Left/Right movement is surrogate-pair safe and otherwise advances one
  Unicode code point at a time. Full grapheme-cluster movement and the matching
  grapheme-segmented visible-column arithmetic remain deferred.
- `set_hidden_areas` merges ranges by source, updates line/layout/decorations/
  cursor, and preserves the top visible model line when folding changes above
  the viewport. Two optional owner continuations bridge the browser-package
  cycle without moving ViewEvents into this common package: the unchanged gate
  runs before `with_event_batch`; on a changed mapping,
  `on_line_mapping_changed` wraps the cursor continuation so the root appends
  Flushed/Mapping/Decorations, cursor, layout, and recovery-scroll facts in
  source order. The payload-free hidden-area outgoing event is emitted only
  when the projected line collection reports a real mapping change, and only
  after `with_event_batch` has returned, so layout and stable-viewport recovery
  are already complete. Equal inputs and force-updates whose mapping is still
  equal do not emit. Headless callers omit both continuations but retain the
  same changed-only outgoing event.
- `model_position_is_hidden_except_source` is the narrow ViewZones policy read:
  it tests the raw per-source ranges without rebuilding the cached union or
  changing the projected line collection.
- A ViewModel may borrow the exact attached-view handle owned by its root
  `ModelData`. Vertical scroll and content remapping publish current model
  visible ranges as unstable; initial setup and explicit view-state restore
  publish the stabilized state. Hidden model ranges are removed in order.
  Model token events are converted through the current projection, delivered
  synchronously to the browser ViewEvent callback, and only then enqueued as
  the original outgoing model event. The listener never forces tokenization.
- `ViewModelDecorations` owns the concrete, package-private inline-decoration
  computer. It queries canonical model decorations, converts ranges through
  the local `CoordinatesConverter`, caches resolved view decorations by
  decoration id, and resolves only the requested viewport. Model-decoration
  and line-mapping notifications clear that cache at the corresponding source
  invalidation boundaries.

## Inline-decoration ownership

The merged package keeps the Monaco source units distinct:

- `inline_decorations.mbt` maps
  `common/viewModel/inlineDecorations.ts`;
- `view_model_decoration.mbt` maps
  `common/viewModel/viewModelDecoration.ts`;
- `view_model_decorations.mbt` maps
  `common/viewModel/viewModelDecorations.ts` plus its called
  `viewModelLines.ts` range-query slice;
- `inline_decorations_reference_wbtest.mbt` maps
  `test/common/viewModel/inlineDecorations.test.ts` and retains all 23 source
  test names.
- `inline_decorations_matrix_wbtest.mbt` covers the additional branch and
  behavior-variable matrix recorded by the ownership plan: overlap/adjacency,
  whole-line and wrapped boundaries, endpoint visibility, invalidation,
  same-position/empty/wrapped injection edges, option/offset producer pairing,
  and consumer preconditions.

The four source-mapped artifacts are pinned to vscode commit
checked-in source; the local matrix derives its cases
from that same source revision and the approved Gate A behavior matrix.
Production uses concrete
`TextModel`, `ModelDecoration`, `ModelDecorationOptions`, and
`CoordinatesConverter` values. Only concrete `ViewModelDecoration` and
`ViewDecorationsCollection` cross the package boundary; computers, contexts,
resolved inputs, and renderer-facing inline values stay private. Injected-text
decoration computation has one owner beside `ModelLineProjection`, including
the source callback order, wrapped clipping, continuation indent, and absolute
base-view-line calculation.

The following source behavior remains explicitly deferred:

- comment/string token visibility, because canonical decoration options have
  no `hideInCommentTokens` or `hideInStringTokens` fields;
- the whole-line `allowZero=false` and `belowHiddenRanges=true` converter
  switches, because the canonical converter exposes affinity only;
- production `beforeContentClassName` reach, because the canonical model
  options lack that field;
- production `affectsFont` reach, because the canonical model options lack
  font-decoration inputs;
- production injected-text letter-spacing reach, because canonical injected
  options lack `inlineClassNameAffectsLetterSpacing`.

The white-box suite uses private resolved-input adapters for the last three
branches. Those cases prove the source algorithms, not product reachability;
the five entries remain `DEFERRED` in the execution-plan ledger.

Run the exact source-named conformance suite with:

```sh
moon test --target js viewer/common/view_model/inline_decorations_reference_wbtest.mbt
moon test --target native viewer/common/view_model/inline_decorations_reference_wbtest.mbt
```

Run the additional local branch matrix with:

```sh
moon test --target js viewer/common/view_model/inline_decorations_matrix_wbtest.mbt
moon test --target native viewer/common/view_model/inline_decorations_matrix_wbtest.mbt
```

There are no `FrameSource`, `FrameViewport`, `RenderLine`, or `RenderFrame` APIs;
browser code consumes `ViewModel` plus `view_layout.ViewportData`. Selection/copy
helpers belong to `viewer/common/core` and the root `viewer`, not this package.

The upstream map is the pinned `src/vs/editor/common/viewModel/` files
`viewModelImpl.ts`, `viewModelLines.ts`, `modelLineProjection.ts`,
`monospaceLineBreaksComputer.ts`, `inlineDecorations.ts`,
`viewModelDecoration.ts`, and `viewModelDecorations.ts`, plus
`viewLayout/viewLinesViewportData.ts`.
This package must remain multi-target and FFI-free, with no root-viewer, browser,
server, transport, workspace, or host dependency. See `pkg.generated.mbti`; run
`moon test --target js viewer/common/view_model` and
`moon test --target native viewer/common/view_model`.
